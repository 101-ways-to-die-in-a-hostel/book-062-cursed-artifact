## Core Information

**Book Number:** 062
**Title:** The Bargain
**Slug:** cursed-artifact
**Category:** Supernatural/Bizarre

## The Death (One Sentence)
A compulsive souvenir collector buys an antique jade figurine from a Moroccan night market, not realizing it's a soul vessel that gradually drains the life force of its owner over seven days.

## Tagline
"You get what you pay for. And then some."

## Themes
1. Commodification of culture - satirizes tourists who treat other cultures as shopping opportunities
2. The true cost of a "bargain" - when something seems too good to be true
3. Colonialism's echoes - Westerners extracting "treasures" from other lands

## Tone Balance
- Comedy: 40% (1-100)
- Horror: 35%
- Satire: 25%

## Target Reader
Anyone who's haggled a local seller down to an absurd price and felt proud, collectors of "authentic" souvenirs, people whose homes are full of objects from places they barely remember.

## Comparison Titles
- "Drag Me to Hell" meets "An Idiot Abroad" with a collector's obsession

## Content Warnings
- Body degradation (rapid aging)
- Financial exploitation themes
- Death by supernatural draining
- Disturbing imagery (mummification while alive)
