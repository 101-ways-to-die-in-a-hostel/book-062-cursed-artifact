# Death Scenario

## The Death (Summary)
**Method:** Cursed jade figurine acts as soul vessel, draining victim's life force over seven days until death by total desiccation
**Category:** Supernatural
**Duration:** Days (seven days from purchase to death)
**Witnesses:** Other hostel guests see his deterioration but attribute it to illness

## Mechanism (Technical)

### The Cause
The jade figurine is a "Taker" - a soul vessel created by a 17th-century Berber sorcerer to trap djinn. The original enchantment was inverted; instead of trapping entities, it now feeds on human life force to keep the djinn inside dormant. Previous owners have fed it enough to keep it satisfied. Brad's refusal to let it go triggers the vessel's hunger protocol - it takes everything.

### The Setup
- The figurine has been passed through many hands over 300 years
- A keeper family in Marrakech has maintained it, ensuring it's never "sold" - only given away or inherited
- Fatima, the current keeper, was tricked into a position where she had to sell (Brad threatened to report her stall to authorities)
- Once sold under duress, the vessel's curse activates fully

### The Trigger
Brad forces the sale by threatening Fatima's livelihood. The moment money exchanges hands under these conditions, the vessel begins feeding.

### The Process
1. Day 1: Brad feels unusually tired, writes it off as jet lag
2. Day 2: Extreme fatigue, notices hair falling out in shower
3. Day 3: Rapid weight loss, skin becoming papery
4. Day 4: Teeth loosening, vision failing
5. Day 5: Cannot stand, appears decades older
6. Day 6: Bedridden, skin becoming translucent, organs visible beneath
7. Day 7: Complete desiccation - every drop of moisture and energy extracted

## Research Notes
- Soul vessels appear in multiple traditions: Jewish dybbukim, Islamic djinn traps, European witch bottles
- Mummification through desiccation: body loses approximately 75% of weight through fluid loss
- Moroccan folklore includes numerous cursed objects, particularly from the colonial period
- The "Taker" concept draws from multiple North African traditions about objects that steal essence

## Foreshadowing Checklist

### Part 1 (Subtle Hints)
Plant these without drawing attention:
- [ ] Hint 1: Other shopkeepers visibly avoid Fatima's stall
- [ ] Hint 2: Brad's expensive watch stops working the moment he touches the figurine
- [ ] Hint 3: A cat hisses and flees when Brad enters the hostel with the figurine

### Part 2 (Obvious Warnings)
These should be noticed but dismissed:
- [ ] Warning 1: Fatima initially refuses to sell at any price, says "Not this one" - Victim's rationalization: "She's just driving up the price, classic technique"
- [ ] Warning 2: She tries to give him other items for free if he'll put it back - Victim's rationalization: "Clearly this is more valuable than I thought"
- [ ] Warning 3: Local hostel guest warns him about buying from "that stall" - Victim's rationalization: "Locals trying to keep treasures for themselves"
- [ ] Warning 4: He wakes to find the figurine in his hand even though he packed it away - Victim's rationalization: "Must have unpacked it in my sleep, was thinking about it"
- [ ] Warning 5: Fatima appears at the hostel, begging him to return it, offering triple the price - Victim's rationalization: "Proof I got an incredible deal, no way I'm selling"

### Part 3 (Explicit Danger)
The threat is now undeniable:
- [ ] Moment 1: Brad sees his reflection showing him decades older while his actual body still appears normal
- [ ] Moment 2: He tries to throw the figurine away but it reappears in his luggage within minutes
- [ ] Moment 3: A doctor tells him he's experiencing organ failure consistent with extreme old age, asks if he's 85

## The Death Sequence (Full Detail)

### Setup (Chapter 35-37)
Brad, now bedridden and appearing 80 years old in a 34-year-old's body, has finally accepted the supernatural nature of his predicament. He tries everything: giving the figurine away (recipients die faster - their life force passes through them to him to the vessel), destroying it (it reassembles), throwing it away (it returns). The hostel staff have called medical services but doctors are baffled.

### Trigger (Chapter 38)
Fatima arrives one final time. She explains he had seven days to return it willingly. That window is now closed. The vessel must complete its feeding. She will try to recover it from his remains.

### The Death (Chapters 39-40)
Write this sequence in full detail:

**Day 6, Night:**
Brad can no longer move. His skin has become like parchment stretched over a frame. He can feel the figurine pulling at something deep inside him - not blood, not breath, but the essential force that makes him alive.

**Day 7, Dawn:**
His eyes, now sunken deep, watch the sunrise through the hostel window. He tries to call out but his voice is just a whisper of air through desiccated tissue.

**Day 7, Noon:**
The feeding intensifies. Brad feels himself being pulled into the jade - not physically, but essentially. For a moment, he perceives the djinn trapped inside, a being of fire reduced to a spark, feeding on the energy to avoid final extinction.

**Final Moment:**
Brad's last thought is a vision: he sees all the previous owners, a chain of the greedy and the desperate, each feeding the vessel a little. He sees that if he'd given it back willingly, he'd have lost only a few years. His refusal condemned him. The last of his essence enters the jade. His body, now a husk weighing perhaps thirty pounds, collapses inward like ancient paper. The jade figurine glows briefly green - satisfied.

### Immediate Aftermath
Housekeeping finds what looks like a mummy in Brad's bed. The figurine is gone - Fatima recovered it before authorities arrived. Medical examiner is baffled; body appears centuries old. Brad's passport and belongings are the only proof of identity. Officially ruled "unexplained death of foreign national."

## Sensory Details

### Sight
The world gradually loses color as his life drains - by day 5, he sees in sepia tones. The figurine increasingly appears to glow.

### Sound
A constant low humming from the figurine, like a sound just below hearing. His own heartbeat getting slower and fainter.

### Touch/Pain
Not pain exactly - a pulling sensation, like something being siphoned from every cell. Extreme cold as circulation fails.

### Smell
Old dust, dry decay - the smell of tombs. His own body beginning to smell like ancient parchment.

### Taste
His mouth goes dry on day 2 and never recovers. Eventually, even his tongue desiccates. The last taste: copper, as his gums bleed around loosening teeth.

## The Horror Element
The horror is in the gradual, observable nature of the death - watching yourself age and decay while still conscious, unable to stop it, unable to let go of the thing killing you. And the understanding that this was punishment for greed.

## The Comedy Element
The irony of a man who spent his life acquiring things being acquired himself. His final Instagram post gets thousands of comments about the "amazing patina" on the figurine - no one notices he never posts again.

## Secondary Victims
| Name | Relationship to Main Victim | Death |
|------|---------------------------|-------|
| Carlos | Curious backpacker who accepts figurine when Brad tries to give it away | Loses 20 years of life in 6 hours before Brad takes it back, survives as elderly man at 25 |

## The Cover-Up (if any)
Moroccan authorities and the hostel prefer to keep this quiet - "unexplained death" goes in reports, body is cremated after investigation stalls. Brad's family receives ashes and bills. They don't investigate further.

## @HostelReaper Connection
- Graffiti found: Scratched into Brad's locker: "SOLD. FINAL SALE. NO RETURNS."
- Social media post: "Day 7 guarantee: if you're not completely drained, we'll take even more."
- Other: The figurine appears in @HostelReaper's profile pic for exactly 7 days after Brad's death

## Writing Notes

### Pacing the Death
Seven-day structure provides natural pacing. Each day should show marked deterioration while Brad cycles through denial, anger, bargaining, depression - never reaching acceptance.

### POV During Death
Stay in victim's head throughout. The horror is enhanced by his rationalization attempts even as evidence mounts.

### Graphic Content Level
- 7/10 - The body horror of desiccation is explicit but not gory
- Show the physical transformation in detail, especially the horror of watching it happen to yourself
