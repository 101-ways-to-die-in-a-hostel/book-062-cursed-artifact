# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Bradley "Brad" Huntington III
**Nickname/Handle:** @BradsWorldTreasures
**Age:** 34
**Nationality:** American (Connecticut)
**Occupation:** Trust fund kid / "Antique Hunter" / Failed auction house apprentice

## Archetype
**Primary:** Privileged Collector

**Secondary traits:** Trust fund confidence, performative expertise, treats locals as props in his adventures

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Greed

**How it manifests:**
- Haggles aggressively with vendors who clearly need the money
- Brags about getting items "for nothing" that are worth "a fortune"
- Cannot resist a deal, even when something feels wrong
- Treats every purchase as a conquest

**How it kills them:**
His insistence on buying the jade figurine despite the seller's increasingly desperate attempts to discourage him. His refusal to return it when given multiple chances. His inability to let go of something he "won."

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 5'11", soft from never working a physical job, beginning to develop a paunch
- **Hair:** Wavy brown, styled to look "effortlessly" disheveled
- **Distinguishing features:** Family signet ring, expensive watch worn to show it off, perpetual tan from leisure travel
- **Typical outfit:** Linen shirts, expensive khakis, leather sandals, canvas tote bags from upscale museums

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Genuine knowledge about antiquities - becomes patronizing lectures to locals about their own culture
2. Eye for quality - becomes inability to walk away from valuable-looking items

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Entitled bargaining - leads him to pressure a seller into a sale she doesn't want to make
2. Possessiveness - refuses to return the object even when his life depends on it

### Pet Peeves
- Being overcharged (by his standards)
- Knockoffs and reproductions
- Customs regulations on antiquities

### Fears
- Surface fear: Being seen as a tourist rather than a "traveler"
- Deeper fear: That he hasn't earned anything he has

## Background

### Origin Story
Third generation of a Connecticut family that made money in insurance. Grew up surrounded by objects his grandfather "collected" from various colonized nations. Studied art history at Yale, interned at Christie's but was asked to leave after aggressive behavior toward consignors. Now travels the world "discovering" pieces for his personal collection.

### Why They Travel
To build a collection that will finally impress his distant father and prove he's not just a trust fund child but a "real collector."

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Stays in hostels because it makes him feel like a "real traveler" and the savings fund more purchases. The Marrakech hostel is near the medina where he's heard about a night market with "unregulated" antiquities.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "provenance," "patina," "authenticated," "museum quality"
- Avoids words like: "expensive," "I can't afford it," "maybe I shouldn't"
- Catchphrases: "Do you know what this is worth?", "I'll give you [insultingly low price], final offer"

### Speech Pattern
- Confident, slightly condescending
- Name-drops museums and auction houses
- Pronounces foreign words with theatrical precision

### Internal Monologue Style
Constantly appraising everything and everyone, calculating value, comparing to similar pieces he's seen

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram with pretensions of art expertise
- **Follower count:** 45,000 (many purchased)
- **Posting style:** "Discovery" posts of his finds, lectures about cultural history, never shows the haggling
- **Last post before death:** Photo of the jade figurine: "Acquired this stunning Song Dynasty piece from a local source. The jade alone..."

### Online vs Reality
Presents himself as a refined collector; in reality, he's just rich enough to buy things and arrogant enough to claim expertise

## Relationships

### Family
- Father barely acknowledges him despite (because of?) financing his lifestyle
- Mother enables him while competing for the same father's attention

### Friends
- Acquaintances from prep school who tolerate him for party invitations
- No one who knows the real, insecure Brad beneath the confidence

### Romantic
- Series of relationships with women who lose interest when the novelty of his lifestyle fades

### At the Hostel
- Lectures other travelers about "authentic experiences"
- Treats staff like servants while thinking he's being friendly

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes feeling terrible, attributes it to "street food," still makes plans to visit another market

### Their Last Normal Moment
Holding the jade figurine up to the light, admiring its translucence, feeling proud of his bargain

### Final Thoughts
"I should have given it back. She tried to make me give it back. Why didn't I give it back?"

### Last Words
"I'll pay... I'll pay anything..." (offering the figurine back to empty air)
