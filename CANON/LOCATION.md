## The City

### Tourist Scene

- **Type of tourists:** Culture seekers, photographers, shoppers, desert tour clients, package tourists at resorts
- **Danger level:** Moderate - safe from violence but heavy scam culture, aggressive sales tactics, easy to get lost in medina

## Sensory Environment

### Sounds
- Morning: Call to prayer from dozens of mosques in overlapping waves, donkey carts, shopkeepers opening
- Afternoon: Haggling in multiple languages, motorbikes in narrow alleys, hammering from artisans
- Night: Drums and music from Jemaa el-Fnaa, cats fighting, distant revelry
- Unique sounds: The hostel fountain provides constant water noise; the courtyard creates an echo chamber

### Smells
- Hostel: Orange blossom from courtyard, mint tea perpetually brewing, old stone, cedar wood
- Street: Leather from tanneries (infamous), spices, grilled meat, exhaust, incense
- Specific to death location: Brad's room develops a scent of ancient dust and desert dryness

### Textures
- Surfaces: Smooth cool tilework, rough carved plaster, soft faded carpets, brass fixtures
- Climate feel: Dry heat during day, surprising cool at night, pleasant in shade

### Tastes
- Local food: Tagine, couscous, pastilla, mint tea, fresh orange juice, harira soup
- Hostel offerings: Basic breakfast included (bread, jam, eggs, mint tea), cooking facilities

### Visual Details
- Colors: Terracotta, cobalt blue, emerald green, saffron yellow - the famous Marrakech palette
- Light quality: Harsh white outdoors, filtered gold through riad screens, dramatic shadow play
- Distinctive visuals: Geometric zellige patterns, brass lanterns casting star-shaped shadows, riot of goods in souks

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Youssef
**Description:** 26, nephew of the owners, studying business, charming with guests but deeply superstitious beneath professional surface
**Role in death:** Warning-giver (subtly) - tries to discourage Brad from the night market, offers to accompany him

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Khadija | Elderly, sees the figurine on day 2, immediately leaves room, refuses to return |
| Security | None | Medina location provides natural security through maze-like access |
| Bar/Kitchen | Aicha | Morning cook, reads tea leaves as hobby, warns Brad his fortune is "closed" |
| Manager | Hassan | Owner's brother, handles problems, becomes increasingly concerned about Brad's deterioration |

### Staff Knowledge
Youssef and Khadija recognize what the figurine is - or at least the category of object it belongs to. They're terrified but unable to intervene directly. They contact local holy men who refuse to approach. By day 4, staff are avoiding Brad's room entirely.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Tranquil courtyard, guests planning souq excursions, mint tea in the shade, comparing carpet purchases

### Night Vibe
Rooftop gatherings, planning next day's adventures, trading war stories about aggressive salesmen, occasional smoke

### Guest Demographics
Solo travelers and couples, European and American majority, age range 20-40, many on multi-country Morocco tours

### Reputation
"An oasis in the chaos of the medina." Reviews praise the courtyard, location near the souks, helpful staff. Some mention the "intense" energy of the building, usually as a positive.

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Marrakech Menara Airport (20 min taxi), train station (15 min taxi), then walk through medina (hostel sends WhatsApp directions with photos of landmarks)

### Check-in Process
Youssef greets at the entry, provides medina navigation tips, offers to arrange guides and excursions. He specifically warns against unguided night market visits.

### Rules
- Shoes off in courtyard
- Quiet hours after 11 PM
- No outside alcohol in common areas
- Respect during prayer times

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: decent in courtyard, weak in rooms)
- [x] Kitchen

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Marrakech medina is UNESCO World Heritage site, genuinely maze-like
- Riad architecture and conversion to guesthouses is common and well-documented
- Night markets (beyond Jemaa el-Fnaa) exist but are less tourist-friendly
- Moroccan folk beliefs regarding djinn are culturally significant and should be portrayed with respect

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Islam should be portrayed respectfully
- Moroccan people are not "exotic others" - locals should have agency and personality
- The aggressive sales culture is real but shouldn't define all interactions
- Folk beliefs are sincere, not superstition for tourist entertainment

- Lonely Planet Morocco
- Tahir Shah's "In Arabian Nights" and "The Caliph's House"
- Moroccan folklore collections regarding djinn
